  - create for idea action a promise and do something on its end - for learning 
  
  - on create idea button check for logged in state.

  - add a view to mongo, for top liked and hard ideas - so it wont have to search all the DB every time.

  - change the like idea to 1 post request instead of 2 - home.

  - because there are more like clicks than created idea, remove the save of the created idea to the user. 
  
  - on focus: in case of field empty: show last searches, if there are none, show the regular suggestions.
