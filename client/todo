last things:
  - on idea share: will send url, https://localhost:3000/idea/<idea id>

  - on idea change, change also the url , so he will be able to just save to favorites.

  - make title unique - so there wont be any duplicates

  - design search page again.

  - design user page again.
      - remove the shadow 
      - change css and html on empty liked/created ideas
      - make the list in a line in a div container of a line


---------------------------------------------------- FINISH ---------------------------------------------------------------

NTH: 
    - add a view to mongo, for top liked and hard ideas - so it wont have to search all the DB every time.

    - change the like idea to 1 post request instead of 2 - home.

    - because there are more like clicks than created idea, remove the save of the created idea to the user. 
    
    - on focus: in case of field empty: show last searches, if there are none, show the regular suggestions
