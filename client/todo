bugs:
  - delete idea fails
  - on update user idea, need to update idea tags also
  - when liking idea - it adds an 'empty title' idea to user likes
  - when removing like, it removes like from the user in the db, but not from the redux
  - create idea -> like it -> go to liked ideas -> the ideas title is "untitled"

- check the search with more works. 
    - search with more.
    - search without more. 

- add support for any in search - like when the time is X and the num of people is Any , 
  it should give you the results of all people. 
  
AFTER WEBSITE UPLOAD:
  - check the share works, because of the domain, 
  - check everything works.
    - new idea - X
    - search
    - indicators: like, dislike, time+, time- , hard + , hard - 
    - delete idea
    - edit idea
    - top table
    - check links work.
    - check share work from cell phone and regular.
    - check cell phone version works.
    

NTH:  
  - add a view to mongo, for top liked and hard ideas - so it wont have to search all the DB every time.

  - change the like idea to 1 post request instead of 2 - home.

  - on focus: in case of field empty: show last searches, if there are none, show the regular suggestions.
  
  - app stopped being responsive - search page - change the inline block to block!!! :/
