last things:
    - create loading screen till the top ideas will load

    - make all the searches and ideas work from the url , so the users will be able to save them to favorites

    - make title unique?

    - design user page again.
        - remove the shadow 
        - change css and html on empty liked/created ideas

---------------------------------------------------- FINISH ---------------------------------------------------------------

NTH: 
    - add a view to mongo, for top liked and hard ideas - so it wont have to search all the DB every time.

    - change the like idea to 1 post request instead of 2 - home.

    - because there are more like clicks than created idea, remove the save of the created idea to the user. 
    
    - on focus: in case of field empty: show last searches, if there are none, show the regular suggestions
