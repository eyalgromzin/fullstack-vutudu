work:
    - make create idea page pretty  
        - glow
        - size same as search
home:
    - show stats in user page - home
    - clear the create idea page if idea created 
    - support #
    - check # works in search
    - create lists: hardest, most liked, lowest time, and put them in the main page. - at the bottom of the search page - home
    - change the like idea to 1 post request instead of 2 - home.
    - add validations and alerts 
        - on create, must fill all 
        - on search, ???
    - on user page load first time, show liked ideas. 

bugs:
    - search fails sometimes - need to understand when
    - user page, empty the list first on changing type
