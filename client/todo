---------------------------------------------------- DEV FINISH ----------------------------------------------------

- check the search with more works. 
    - search with more 
    - search without more.

AFTER WEBSITE UPLOAD:
  - check the share works, because of the domain, 
  - check everything works.
    - new idea
    - search
    - indicators: like, dislike, time+, time- , hard + , hard - 
    - delete idea
    - edit idea
    - top table
    - check links work.
    - check share work from cell phone and regular.
    - check cell phone version works.
    
NTH: 
  - on create idea button check for logged in state.

  - add a view to mongo, for top liked and hard ideas - so it wont have to search all the DB every time.

  - change the like idea to 1 post request instead of 2 - home.

  - because there are more like clicks than created idea, remove the save of the created idea to the user. 
  
  - on focus: in case of field empty: show last searches, if there are none, show the regular suggestions    

  - on search click, change the url to show the idea - because more is not mandatorty - dunno how to do it!!!!
